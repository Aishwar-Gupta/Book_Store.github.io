# Book_Store_MERN
**BookStore App using MERN Stack**

## DESCRIPTION:
The project uses MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.JS, React.JS, and Node.JS), to perform the CRUD functionalities (Create, Remove, Update, and Delete) over the database to update the books stored in the bookstore. The books have the following fields - name of the book, author, description, price, image URL, and availability. The Bookstore allows functionalities to display all the books, and even remove and update individual books.

## INSTALLATIONS:

* [x] AXIOS - To make server-side requests, such as, get, post, put, etc.
* [x] CORS - To disable default cors from the browser.

* [x] REACT - To use React.JS for the frontend of the app.
